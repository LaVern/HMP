Finance - Heavenly Father, it is symptomatic of our life today that economics play a large part in it.  People labor zealously for a wage so that they can acquire the needs of life.  They also work for the so called luxuries of life, for the opportunity to have more leisure to develop themselves in ways, and to keep up with their particular state of life.  Right now, I find myself in a bad economic condition.  I just cannot seem to make enough money to meet my obligations.  Please help me in this dangerous situation.  Teach me to live within my means while at the same time striving to increase those means.  Let me never lose heart but continue to press on.  Most of all, inspire me to seek first Your kingdom in the knowledge that everything else will be given me together with it.  In Jesus Christ's name I pray, who lives and reigns with the Father and the Holy Spirit One God forever and ever.

I do not know how to go out or come in. 8  And your servant is in the midst of your people whom you have chosen, a great people, too many to be numbered or counted for multitude. 9  Give your servant therefore an understanding mind to govern your people, that I may discern between good and evil, for who is able to govern this your great people?

Open your eyes and see our desolations, and the city that is called by your name. For we do not present our pleas before you because of our righteousness, but because of your great mercy. 19 O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive. O Lord, pay attention and act. Delay not, for your own sake, O my God, because your city and your people are called by your name.  Amen

Wisdom - 1 Kings 3:6:9 The Solomon said, Thou hast shown great loving kindness to Thy servant David my father, according as he walked before Thee in truth and righteousness and uprightness of heart toward Thee; and Thou hast reserved for him this great loving kindness, that Thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day. And now, O Lord my God, Thou hast made Thy servant king in place of my father David, yet I am but a little child; I do not know how to go out or come in.
